# CWD_Playground

## Introduction
Currently learning Python as of 13th January 2025.\
Welcome to **`cwd_playground`** – my personal code playground! This is where I get to try out new Python concepts and features as I learn them. It’s the place where I can experiment, make mistakes, and have fun while reinforcing what I’m learning. Think of it as my "code add-along" for all the things I’m discovering.

## Purpose
This is a repo that I have decided to create as a "code add-along" for all the new things I learn along the way and how I can incorporate them into my "current working directory playground" (cwd_playground).
This was something I should have done during my previous learning of C, but I was too far in to start over or create a playground. Now that I have just started Python (which I'm enjoying more), I thought I'd start early and create this playground.

In the coming days, I'll add instructions on how you can run this app locally via your terminal of choice, provide feedback, or even suggest features that I can try to implement.
